* sample_photo.npz is a photo of a tarte tatin :). The photo was taken by Jack Kelly.
  It is released under a Public Domain Dedication (CC0) license. It is included here
  to be used as a sample dataset. A "real" photo is likely to compress in a more realistic
  way than an array of random numbers, or an array of all-zeros or all-ones.
